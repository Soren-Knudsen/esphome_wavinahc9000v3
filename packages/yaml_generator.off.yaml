# yaml_generator.off.yaml - DISABLED placeholder for YAML generator
# This file intentionally defines no text sensors or services to reduce clutter
# once onboarding is complete. Switch between on/off using a substitution, e.g.:
#
# substitutions:
#   YAML_GEN_STATE: off  # change to on when you need the generator
#
# packages:
#   yaml_generator: !include packages/yaml_generator.${YAML_GEN_STATE}.yaml
#
# (You still keep the debug services file separately if desired.)
